# Virtual Drag and Drop Using Human Hand Detection

## **Overview**
This project implements a virtual drag-and-drop system using real-time hand detection and gesture recognition. Users can interact with a draggable object on their webcam feed by performing simple hand gestures, such as pinching their thumb and index finger together to "grab" the object and moving it across the screen.

---

## **Features**
1. Real-time hand detection using the **Mediapipe Hands module**.
2. Recognition of hand gestures for "grab" and "release" actions.
3. Dragging and dropping an on-screen object (a blue circle).
4. Simple and intuitive interaction with no external hardware required.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video and rendering visual feedback.
- **Mediapipe**: For hand detection and tracking.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**
1. Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed on your system:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   If not installed, download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```

### **2. Download the Code**
1. Copy the provided script.
2. Save it as `drag_and_drop.py` in your working directory.

### **3. Run the Code**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/script
   ```
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python drag_and_drop.py
   ```

## **How to Use**
1. **Start the Application**: The webcam feed will open in a new window.
2. **Hand Gestures**:
   - **Grab**: Pinch your thumb and index finger together to "grab" the object.
   - **Drag**: Move your hand to drag the object.
   - **Release**: Separate your thumb and index finger to drop the object.
3. Press **'q'** to exit the application.

## **Code Explanation**
### **1. Hand Detection**
The Mediapipe Hands module detects the user's hand and identifies 21 key landmarks on the hand. This allows tracking of specific points such as the thumb tip and index finger tip.

### **2. Gesture Recognition**
The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip. If the distance is below a certain threshold, it identifies a "grab" gesture.

### **3. Drag-and-Drop Logic**
When a "grab" gesture is detected, the object position is updated to follow the hand's index finger. The "release" gesture stops this interaction.

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Webcam Not Opening**:
   - Ensure your webcam is functional and not in use by another application.
   - Try running the script as an administrator.

2. **Library Errors**:
   - Reinstall missing libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
     ```

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Reduce the webcam resolution by adding the following lines after `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)`:
     ```python
     cap.set(3, 640)  # Width
     cap.set(4, 480)  # Height
     ```

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. Add support for dragging multiple objects.
2. Implement gestures for resizing or rotating objects.
3. Build a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like **Tkinter** or **PyQt**.
4. Deploy as a web-based solution using **Flask** or **Streamlit**.

---

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and gesture recognition. By leveraging Mediapipe and OpenCV, users can interact with virtual objects naturally, opening the door for innovative human-computer interaction projects.
